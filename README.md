# Predicting-NBA-Salaries

Description

This project was self directed, and looks at NBA statistics of each player and multiple regression to predict their "worth" as a percentage of the NBA salary cap. Although this is not completely comprehensive, it does a pretty good job of predicting salaries, and it will be interesting to see how it fares in the NBA offseason as new contracts are signed.

Requirements

The project was completed using R in RStudio, but the HTML file or PDF file can be opened for easy reading. For the R Markdown file, RStudio will be necessary.
